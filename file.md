Design Engineer Candidate Assignment: Ambient Motion Prototype
Overview
Create a lightweight, visually compelling ambient motion element for a marketing website header or navigation that reflects Onebrief’s brand "vibes" without requiring deep product context.
Think "lava lamp" energy without being literally a lava lamp. Subtle, tasteful motion that adds life at the top of a page.

Goals
Demonstrate design craft plus coding skill at a senior or principal level
Show how you work as a design engineer using modern AI tools for acceleration
Produce a small, polished prototype in a tight timebox

Prompt
Design and build a passive, brand‑aligned ambient motion effect that could live in a website’s top banner or navigation area.
Not literal lava blobs. Examples of directionality (but take these more as inspiration, not literally please):
A starfield or parallax field that subtly drifts
A softly animated gradient surface or noise field
Particles that respond gently to scroll or time
The motion should be calm, tasteful, and performance‑conscious.
It should look good in both light and dark contexts.
Keep it self‑contained and easy to embed at the top of a marketing or product page.
Feel free to use whatever is publicly available about the company or from the in-product screenshot down below

Timebox
Aim for no more than 2 hours of focused effort. It’s okay if you explore more on your own time, but we’ll evaluate within this scope.

Requirements
Build a working prototype. Tooling is your choice.
Examples: HTML/CSS/JS, React, Canvas/WebGL, SVG, CSS shaders, Three.js, Spline, etc.
Using AI tools (e.g., Cursor, v0, Claude/Code, Copilot) is expected. Please show how you leveraged them.
Do not rely solely on a no‑code export; demonstrate real coding beyond simple parameter tweaks.
Keep dependencies minimal. Prefer lightweight libraries over heavy frameworks.
Performance: target smooth animation on a typical laptop without fans spinning up.
Accessibility: ensure the effect is non‑disruptive. Provide a way to pause or reduce motion if applicable.
Responsiveness: looks good on common desktop sizes; a simple mobile fallback is a plus.

Deliverables
A link to your live prototype or a runnable repo (with quick start instructions)
A short README (1 page max) that covers:
Intent and brand rationale: what feeling are you trying to convey?
Technical approach: stack, architecture, key decisions
AI usage: what prompts/agents you used and where they helped
Performance and accessibility considerations
What you would productionize next if given more time
1–2 screenshots or a short GIF for quick preview in the doc

Evaluation Focus
Design translation and taste: fidelity, restraint, and brand alignment
Technical depth: rendering approach, performance, and code clarity
AI‑assisted workflow: effective prompt decomposition, iteration speed, and discernment
Enablement mindset: how easily can others adopt or reuse your work?
Delivery under constraint: scope discipline and polish within the timebox
Scoring uses a 1–4 scale across these dimensions.

Nice‑to‑haves (optional)
Subtle interactivity tied to time, scroll, or mouse movement that remains non‑distracting
A brief design token hook or theming switch (light/dark)
Toggle to reduce motion for accessibility

How to Submit
Share a link to your prototype and repo (if applicable)
Include your README and preview media
If hosting is an issue, provide a zip with clear instructions to run locally in under 2 minutes
We’ll follow up with discussion questions in the next round.

Notes
This assignment avoids heavy product specificity so you can focus on craft and engineering signal.
Feel free to use AI to accelerate, but we’ll look for your judgment and underlying code competence.

Questions
If anything is unclear, reply to the recruiter email thread and we’ll clarify quickly.
